# Modelling_&_controlling_minseg_bot
The goal of this project was to create a control system that maintains the minseg robot in the upright position and protects it from small impulses.

An important part of designing high‐performance mechatronic systems is developing representative mathematical models for the system. A model‐based control design will deliver required performance if the model is accurate enough, if the controller is designed methodically, and the controller is robust with respect to uncertainties.

The robot includes:
‐ Arduino Mega MCU
‐ 3 DoF Accelerometer
‐ 3 DoF Gyroscope‐ Magnetometer
‐ Lego NXT DC motor
‐ Motor driver
‐ Encoder
‐ Bluetooth module
